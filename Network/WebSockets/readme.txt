Notes about the Websocket library/code:
Please MOVE the Websocket library folder that's included here to the Arduino libraries before compiling.
This is a fix from the library made available by morrissinger in his github (https://github.com/morrissinger/ESP8266-Websocket) to make it compile for the ESP32.
